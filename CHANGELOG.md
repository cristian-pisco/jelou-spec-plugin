# Changelog

## [0.3.61] — 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- Add jelou/references/claude-code-runtime.md with the name mapping, mandatory ToolSearch preload step, and usage rules.
- Dispatch skills (new-task, execute-task, map-codebase) now prepend the contract to the subagent prompt before the workflow content.
- Inline skills (refine-task, close-task, create-pr, extend-phase, post-slack, rollback-phase, sync-clickup, load-context) load the contract in a new Phase 1b and replace `question` in allowed-tools with AskUserQuestion and ToolSearch.

## [0.3.60] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- add bin/changelog-entry.py: parses the commit message (HEREDOC, -m "...", -m '...'), bumps the patch version in all three manifests, and prepends a categorized entry to CHANGELOG.md
- route .claude/hooks/pre-commit-version-bump.sh through the new script, skip on --amend, and block the commit with exit 2 if the message cannot be parsed so CHANGELOG and version never drift

## [0.3.59] — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- `close-task`: reads `## Branching → Mode` (not `Setup Mode`) so branch-mode cleanup dispatches correctly.
- `jlu-conflict-resolver`: binary-file detection uses `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD` instead of `MERGE_HEAD` — git populates the former during cherry-pick conflicts.
- `rollback-phase`: legacy fallback treats a missing `## Branching` section as `Mode: worktree`, so pre-upgrade tasks can still roll back.

### Changed
- `create-pr`: unified sync-marker format to a per-service map (`Sync markers: <service-id>: alpha=<sha>, production=<sha>`) in both Step 2 (read) and Step 5b.8 (write). Flat `Last-alpha`/`Last-cp` fields removed from the live schema; legacy flat fields are still honored on read for backwards compatibility.
- `new-task` Step 8c and `jlu-tasks-agent` TASKS.md template now describe the `Sync markers` block instead of the old flat fields.

## [0.3.57] — 2026-04-15

### Added
- Branch-only setup mode: `/jlu-new-task` asks (after spec approval) whether to use the full worktree+Docker setup or a lightweight branch-only setup.
- Dual-PR support: tasks can opt into producing a second PR targeting `alpha`. The `staging/<slug>` branch is synthesized on-demand at `/jlu-create-pr` time by cherry-picking production commits onto a fresh cut of `origin/alpha`.
- `jlu-conflict-resolver` sub-agent (sonnet): runs cherry-pick loops and resolves merge conflicts using SPEC + adjacent code as evidence.

### Changed
- Branch naming: `spec/<slug>` is replaced by `production/<slug>` (mandatory) and optional `staging/<slug>`. Old tasks continue to use the legacy name through close.
- `/jlu-new-task`: environment setup (worktree, Docker) is now deferred until after spec approval. Aborted or declined tasks leave no filesystem or Docker state behind.
- `/jlu-create-pr`: records two PRs in `TASKS.md` and `CLICKUP_TASK.json` when `DUAL_PR = yes`; cross-links sibling PR URLs in both PR bodies.
- `/jlu-close-task`: tears down the staging side (closes PR, removes remote/local `staging/<slug>`) regardless of whether the alpha PR was merged. Closure requires only the trunk PR to be merged.
- `/jlu-execute-task`: in branch mode, auto-checks out `production/<slug>` in each service repo before the first phase; aborts if the working tree is dirty or the branch does not exist locally.

### Internal
- Removed `new-task.md` Step 9 (background worktree subtask). Replaced with Step 15b (mode selection) and Step 15c (setup subtask) that run only after spec approval.
- `jlu-git-agent` simplified: operates only on `production/<slug>`; no paired pushes; no dual-PR awareness.
- `jlu-report-task` detects stale `.worktrees/<slug>-staging-tmp` directories older than 1 hour.

## [0.3.19]

### Added

- **OpenCode integration support**: Core workflows now support OpenCode runtime for faster code execution and generation within the spec-driven development environment

## [0.3.7]

### Changed

- **Auto-detect spec templates**: `/jlu:new-task` no longer asks users to pick a template. The interview automatically detects which domains the task involves and merges all applicable templates. Cross-cutting tasks get combined FR/NFR scaffolding and interview hints from multiple templates.
- Domain-aware gap detection as fallback for tasks not covered by any template (API, UI, DB, events)

## [0.3.6]

### Added

- **Spec compliance review** in `/jlu:create-pr`: new `jlu-spec-reviewer` agent checks code diff against SPEC.md requirements before PR creation
- **Requirements coverage table** (COVERED / PARTIALLY_COVERED / UNTESTED / MISSING) with file:line evidence
- **Scope creep detection** flags code changes not mentioned in spec or proposal
- **Compliance report** included in PR description as a collapsible `<details>` section
- Non-blocking gate: user can proceed with known gaps or abort to implement missing requirements

## [0.3.5]

### Added

- **Incremental codebase analysis**: `/jlu:map-codebase` auto-detects changes since last analysis and only re-analyzes affected docs
- **`.last-analysis.json` marker** tracks the commit SHA of the last analysis
- **File categorization heuristic** maps changed files to the docs they affect
- Structural and operational analyzer agents support **incremental update mode**

## [0.3.4]

### Added

- **Conflict detection** in `/jlu:new-task`: warns when a new task overlaps with active tasks on the same services
- Requires explicit user confirmation to proceed when conflicts are found

## [0.3.3]

### Added

- **Automatic spec versioning**: SPEC.md snapshots saved to `versions/SPEC-v<N>.md` after each interview or refinement
- **Human-readable spec changelog** at `versions/SPEC-changelog.md` with Added/Changed/Removed sections
- **Retroactive first version** creation if versioning is added to an existing task via `/jlu:refine-task`

## [0.3.2]

### Added

- **`/jlu:rollback-phase` command**: manually reset service worktrees to the last known-good phase state
- **Commit SHA tracking** per phase in TASKS.md (recorded during `/jlu:execute-task`)
- **Pre-execution commit baseline** for rolling back to before any phase started

## [0.3.1]

### Added

- **Spec templates**: 4 built-in templates (REST API, UI component, database migration, event consumer) pre-fill SPEC.md sections and guide the interview
- **Template registry** at `<WORKSPACE_PATH>/templates/` supports custom user-defined templates
- **Template selection step** in `/jlu:new-task` workflow (Step 2c) — templates are auto-copied from plugin on first use

## [0.3.0]

### Changed

- **9 skill launchers now execute workflows directly** instead of spawning a redundant Opus sub-agent. Saves 10-30s latency per command invocation. Affected commands: close-task, create-pr, report-task, refresh-skills, post-slack, load-context, sync-clickup, refine-task, extend-phase.
- **map-codebase uses 2 Sonnet agents instead of 7 Opus agents.** Two consolidated analyzers (structural + operational) replace six individual researchers plus a cross-validator. ~7x reduction in token cost per codebase analysis.
- **Proposal agent downgraded from Opus to Sonnet.** Structured document generation doesn't need Opus-level reasoning.
- **User stories generated during sync-clickup** instead of execute-task. Stories are only consumed by ClickUp, so they're created at sync time.
- **Model tiers are now configurable** via `models` section in `.spec-workspace.json`. Users can override per agent group (orchestrator, research, code, proposal, operational).

### Added

- **Update notifications** — Every `/jlu:*` command silently checks for newer versions on GitHub (cached 4h, 2s timeout). Prints a one-line banner if an update is available. Skips in CI environments.

### Removed

- **CONTEXT.md generation** — duplicated information already in phase files and codebase knowledge files.
- **Observability events** in close-task — write-only artifact with no consumer.
- **Cross-validator agent** — consolidated agents see the full codebase, eliminating contradictions.
- **6 individual research agents** — replaced by 2 consolidated analyzers.

## [Unreleased — pre-0.3.0]

- Add AskUserQuestion mandate to all 7 workflow files (new-task, refine-task, execute-task, close-task, create-pr, extend-phase, map-codebase)
